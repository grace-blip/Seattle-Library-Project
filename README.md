# Seattle-Library-Project

The purpose of this project is to analyze Seattle library checkout records and demonstrate data analysis skills using Jupyter Notebook.

## Source Data in Kaggle

Due to the large size of the files under analysis in this project, the files are hosted on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gracefinlayson/seattle-library-checkouts-2020-august-2024). These files once downloaded to the correct folder will function properly in conjunction with the Jupyter notebook.
