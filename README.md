# Seattle-Library-Project

This is my firs portfolio project whose purpose is to analyze Seattle library checkout records and practice data visualization and analysis skills using pandas and seaborn. 

For easy reading please open the pdf file to view the results of the juptyer notebook, note that some of the code is cut off. If you would like to download the jupyter file please follow the instructions below to ensure the notebook functions properly.

Check up regularly on my github to see updates I make to this project and any other projects I undertake!

## Source Data in Kaggle

Due to the large size of the files under analysis in this project, the files are hosted on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gracefinlayson/seattle-library-checkouts-2020-august-2024). In order to get the Jupyter notebook working properly
1. Clone the git directory to your local system.
2. Create a directory in the downloaded project labeled **kaggle_files**.
3. Download the zip file [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gracefinlayson/seattle-library-checkouts-2020-august-2024).
4. Extract the zip file to the folder **kaggle_files**.
5. Run the jupyter notebook like normal.
